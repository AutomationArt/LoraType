### LoraType..|
First of all, our priority is to make the user experience as simple as possible. It only has an on/off button, a widespread QWERTY-keyboard and a cute e-ink display. That’s it. However, in spite of simplicity the Loratype can be used as a tiny PC with possibility for programming and adding new functions thanks to embedded wi-fi, bluetooth and esp32. Welcome on board and feel like home, dear like-minded fellows! There are some extra features: the LoRa-protocol is noise-resistant, and the communication range is about 1 km in a city and up to 7 km in line-of-sight coverage. And of course it is totally free of charge, Loratype has been created not by a Corporation for population, but by people for people . Thus, in any emergency condition we will honorably stay together!

###How Does it Work?

1. Turn on the device
2. Wait a moment (search for interlocutors in the mesh network)
3. Chat, stay in touch without paying for traffic!

**This project is open source. We opened all circuits and software**

### Device features

- FREE OF CHARGE (Lora user doesn't need to pay for the service)
- AUTONOMOUS DEVICE (I am developing LoraType to be completely autonomous)
- INDEPENDED OF INTERNET, 5G, GSM ETC. (Stay connected without Internet!)

### USE CASES

- During disasters like earthquakes, floods, hurricanes, and fires among others
- Hiking or camping far away from cities, receptions etc
- In a war zone or mass protests (when government could shut down the internet)
- When you need free messaging (your plan is expired or you do not have a mobile data on your phone)

### We have passed several important stages of product development

| **Display**  | Durable low power screen that can store information for up to 6 months without consuming power (1.54 inch e-paper display module partial refresh E-ink screen, [GDEH0154D67](https://www.good-display.com/product/1.54-inch-e-paper-display-module-partial-refresh-E-ink-screen,-GDEH0154D67-208.html "GDEH0154D67"))   |
| **Main controller ** | The [ESP32](https://www.espressif.com/sites/default/files/documentation/esp32-wroom-32e_esp32-wroom-32ue_datasheet_en.pdf "ESP32") module gives the device great advantages in development and functionality. You only need to replace the firmware over the air   |
| **Lora Module**  | The [E22](https://www.ebyte.com/en/product-view-news.aspx?id=437 "E22") series is the first wireless module in China to adopt Semtech's SX1262, SX1268 RF chip. This chip provides a variety of modulation methods, such as LoRaTM and traditional GFSK. Its special LoRaTM modulation method increases the communication distance.    |
